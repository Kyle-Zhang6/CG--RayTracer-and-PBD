## Learning Computer Graphics

###### Started from __June 2020__

Majoring Information and Communication Engineering, I've been dealing with hardware much more than software. Mostly I use C to program micro-controller(MCU) like STM32 and VHDL to program FPGA, so that I could complete some work about signal processing or system controlling. 

I'm completely new to this area. The reason why I would like to learn Computer Graphics is that I do enjoy watching TV series and movies. They are really relaxing and inspiring sometimes. As a superhero fan, I love MARVEL and DC quite a lot. And I can easily be inspired by those amazing special effects in the movies, hoping that I could participate in producing such things one day. And of course since I do need to deal with image processing sometime, I know there are  overlaps between image processing, computer vision and computer graphics in both researching and industry, for example, AR/VR/XR, which are really fascinating to me. I believe with the knowledge of all of them, I might be able to perform better work in some comprehensive systems. 

As for this directory, I will upload some of my work using C++ to render some scenes, as a record of my learning process. 





And there is a photo of mine in '.\xfolder', if you would like to know me haha.
